# Reddit Comment Complexity

This is a script that analyzes the sentiment and complexity of Reddit comments across different communities. It utilizes the Reddit `.json` API, which is free but rate-limited. So, when you hit the limit (you will eventually), just take a break and come back later!

## Overview

This tool allows you to:
1. Fetch the top posts from a subreddit.
2. Collect all comments associated with those posts.
3. Perform sentiment analysis and text complexity analysis on the collected comments.

## Rate Limiting

Please note that you will hit Reddit’s rate limits at some point (HTTP 429 responses). If that happens, simply step away for a while to avoid getting blocked. :)

## Files and Functions

### `main.py`
- This is the entry point that runs everything. Use this!


#### but if you want to get nitty-gritty


### `get_outgoing_links.py`
- **Purpose**: Fetches all the threads from the top posts of a subreddit.
- **How it works**: It goes through multiple pages (or up to your defined upper bound) and stores the post URLs in a CSV file.
- **Input/Output**: CSV file with the URLs of the top threads.

### `get_comments_from_urls.py`
- **Purpose**: Takes the CSV file generated by `get_outgoing_links.py` and extracts all the comments from the URLs in the file.
- **Note**: Be aware of rate-limiting issues (HTTP 429 errors) when calling Reddit’s API for comments.
- **Input/Output**: CSV file with the comments for each URL.

### `sentiment.py`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the sentiment of the comments in the provided CSV file.
- **How it works**: Uses a sentiment analysis model to compute the average sentiment and provides insights into the overall tone of the comments.

### `text_age.py`
- **Purpose**: Measures the "age" or complexity of the text.
- **How it works**: Uses various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the complexity of the text and its readability.

### `beautify.py`
- **Purpose**: A helper script to clean and format the data as needed before processing.
- **Functionality**: It removes unwanted characters, trims whitespace, and performs basic text normalization tasks.
